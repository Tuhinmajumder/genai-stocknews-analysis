        "**What is Prompt Engineering?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt engineering is the art and science of designing effective prompts to guide LLMs toward generating the desired output. It's about understanding how LLMs process information and using that knowledge to create prompts that are clear, specific, and unambiguous.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is Prompt Engineering Important?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Accuracy:** Well-crafted prompts significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of the generated responses.\n",
        "* **Control:**  Prompt engineering gives you control over the style, format, and content of the output.\n",
        "* **Efficiency:** Effective prompts can minimize the number of iterations needed to achieve the desired results, saving time and resources.\n",
        "* **Customization:** Prompt engineering allows you to tailor the LLM's behavior to specific tasks and domains.\n",

        "**1.  Clear and Specific Instructions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Bad Prompt:**  \"Tell me about dogs.\"  (Too vague, could result in a wide range of responses.)\n",
        "* **Good Prompt:** \"Write a 200-word essay comparing and contrasting the characteristics of Golden Retrievers and German Shepherds.\" (Specific, sets length and topic.)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**2.  Few-Shot Learning:**\n",
